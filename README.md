# **Introduction to myself and my project**

Hello everyone! :smiley:

My name is Zaida Escila Martinez Moreno :woman:. I was born in Mexico :mexico: and came to Canada on 2017 to fulfill my dream of studying Neuroscience abroad :woman_scientist:.

With a background in Biology :panda_face:, I was not familiar with anything, from programming :computer: to psychology, anatomy or behaviour, much less with **neuroimaging techniques** such as **_fMRI, MEG and EEG_**; or with **analysis software** such as Brainstorm for MEG and FSL, SPM, AFNI or Nistats for fMRI. Since then, I have been in the adventure of understanding everything.

I started to work with fMRI when I decided to join a project that consisted in the comparison of the same stimulus in both, fMRI and MEG. Therefore, I needed to create the stimulus on **MatLab** (the preferred language in my lab). Then I developed a code to present the same stimulus first to MEG and afterwards, to fMRI.

Finally, I got the raw data: DICOM and MNC files. However, I didn't know how to begin and what to do, and after looking on the Internet, I got the names of some tools and some steps but not all of them. What I want to do with this project is **to build a webpage that contains as many of these options as it is possible, with comparisons and options on how to analyze the data**. But I also want to create a pipeline that allows you to follow the analysis and let's you understand each of its steps.

## :link: **Goals**

- [x] Create the Github repository. :heavy_check_mark:
- [x] Create the introductory `.md` file. :heavy_check_mark:
- [ ] Create the draft of the webpage.
- [ ] Choose the example dataset.
- [ ] :soon:
