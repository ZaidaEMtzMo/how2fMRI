## The data

Description of the experiment.

## Conversion to NIFTI

The standard output of a MRI scanner (Magnetic resonance imaging) is DICOM, although it sometimes can be found as NIFTI.

The first thing you will need to do is to convert the DICOM files that look like this:

``` bash
MR.1.3.12.2.1107.5.2.43.167017.2017121412583114227636143
MR.1.3.12.2.1107.5.2.43.167017.2017121412583131155436146
MR.1.3.12.2.1107.5.2.43.167017.2017121412583148080636149
MR.1.3.12.2.1107.5.2.43.167017.2017121412583165051536152
MR.1.3.12.2.1107.5.2.43.167017.2017121412583181919336155
MR.1.3.12.2.1107.5.2.43.167017.2017121412583198848836158
```

into NIFTI data. To do so, can run this command in any bash terminal.
First, write in a terminal:

`sudo apt-get install dcm2niix`

Then, run the next command. Be sure to add the path where you want the data to be written. If you want more information about the command, just check out the help command or go to their webpage [here](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix).

`dcm2nii -o $PATH_FOR_OUTPUT $PATH_DICOM_FILES`

The type of files you can find after the conversion could be: [localizers](#1-localizers), [structural MRI](#2-structural-mri), [functional MRI](#3-functional-mri) or [distortion fields](#4-distortion-fields).

As an output, you will get something similar to:

``` bash
20171214_120713BOLDMOSAIC12815mmisos007a001.nii.gz
20171214_120713BOLDMOSAIC12815mms003a001.nii.gz
20171214_120713BOLDMOSAIC12815mms004a001.nii.gz

20171214_120713DistortionMapPAs006a1001.nii.gz
20171214_120713localizers001a1001A.nii.gz

o20171214_120713MPRAGEADNIiPAT2s002a1001.nii.gz
```

For now, the files that matter to us are the structural scan (`20171214_120713MPRAGEADNIiPAT2s002a1001.nii.gz`), the functional files (`20171214_120713BOLDMOSAIC12815mms003a001.nii.gz` and `20171214_120713BOLDMOSAIC12815mms004a001.nii.gz`) and the distortion maps(`20171214_120713DistortionMapAPs005a1001.nii.gz` and `20171214_120713DistortionMapPAs006a1001.nii.gz`.

## BIDS formatting

The dataset provided for this analysis is not extense, but in neuroimaging, it is common to have huge datasets. In recent years, it has been proposed to use a standard way to organize all of the neuroimaging data. This proposal is called *Brain Imaging Data Structure* ([BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)) and in this chapter, I will give you the tools to do it, but you can also consult this [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201644).

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZaidaEMtzMo/how2fMRI/master/Media/Figure1.png "BIDS formatting example. As found in <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>")

First, you will need to convert your DICOM files to NIFTI files as these are the standard format that BIDS use. Then, I will recommend that you check out the next resources:

1. This video in YouTube from _math et al_ that explains in detail how to do the conversion:

[![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZaidaEMtzMo/how2fMRI/master/Media/Figure2.png "DICOM to BIDS conversion by math et al on YouTube 2018.")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAv9WuyyF3g)

## Onset files

*These files are only needed in a task-based fMRI.*

Onset files are necessary to specify what stimulus was played at what time. Every software requires them to be in a specific way. In the case of **_FSL_**, you must have one file per stimulus.

## Distortion / Field Maps

Echo-planar imaging (EPI) images can be quite distorted due to B0 inhomogeneities, which in the brain are especially pronounced near the sinuses. While signal lost to these inhomogeneities cannot be recovered, signal that has been merely displaced can be returned to its proper location in the image if a map of the B0 field has been acquired. In this [document](https://lcni.uoregon.edu/kb-articles/kb-0003), you will find the specific instructions to do the acquisition and to use the field maps that you could need for your data. However, I will explain here the steps to do it on the provided dataset.

Among the files, you will find two scans called Distortion Maps:

``` bash
20171214_120713DistortionMapAPs005a1001.nii.gz
20171214_120713DistortionMapPAs006a1001.nii.gz
```

1. Use `fslmerge` to combine the two files into one 4D file where the forth dimension is time:

``` bash
fslmerge -t $NameOfOutput $InputAPDirection $InputPADirection
```

2. Create the *datain* file for this scan. For this, you will need the next values:

   1. Phase encode direction:

        In the **json** file of each of your Distortion Map, look for the field called  "**PaseEncodingDirection**":
  
``` json
"PhaseEncodingDirection": "j",
```

        You will be able
        
   1. 2. Total readout time in seconds for the se-epi acquisition (time from the center of the first echo to the center of the last).
